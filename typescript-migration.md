# TypeScript migrations at scale

## Abstract
TypeScript provides a great way to add type safety to your JavaScript.  At Google, we've started the process of moving many of our npm modules over to TypeScript with great results - but it didn't come without a fair bit of trial and error.

This talk will dive into various approaches to converting your codebase, tools you can use to make the transition easier, and our experiences going through a large scale JavaScript => TypeScript transition.
