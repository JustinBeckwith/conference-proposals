# Get microservicey with Node.js, Kubernetes and gRPC

## Abstract
The microservice architectural pattern promotes building small, single purpose services that make it easier to build and maintain complex applications. Deploying a ton of small services might sound hard - but Docker, Kubernetes, and gRPC make orchestrating the deployment of interconnected services easier (and dare we say fun). In this talk we're going to cover using Docker and Kubernetes to run scalable Node.js applications across a fleet of machines. When it's time for our services to communicate - we'll take a look at using gRPC, Google's HTTP/2 based RPC framework to enable simple communication across multiple languages. Join us as we run through the world of node.js and microservice architecture at Google.
