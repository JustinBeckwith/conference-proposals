# The tools of scalable OSS

## Abstract
Managing open source projects can be difficult. Writing the code is fun part: but then you need to deal with managing issues, keeping dependencies up to date, and cutting releases.  As the number of repositories you manage goes up... these challenges compound even further.

In this talk we'll discuss the challenges with managing multiple open source projects, the philosophy our team uses to reduce the stress, and a set of specific tools that can make your life easier.  Please join me to talk about the scalable tools of OSS.
