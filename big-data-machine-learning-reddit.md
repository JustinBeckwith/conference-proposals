# Using BigQuery and Machine Learning to analyze Reddit

## Abstract
Gathering deep meaning from images has traditionally been hard. The Google Cloud Vision API can quickly classify images into thousands of categories, detect individual objects, landmarks, animals, and even facial expressions. Combining the vast amount of data on Reddit with this API can produce some interesting results - and lots of data! In this talk we'll show how to build a data analysis pipeline from Reddit, analyze the media with the Cloud Vision API, and stream it into Google BigQuery for real time analysis - all in JavaScript.
