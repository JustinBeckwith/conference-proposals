# Prune Your Dependency Tree

## Abstract
If it's on `npm`, it must be good ... right?  One of the best things about node.js is the vibrant ecosystem of existing packages.  But choose wisely!  The packages you choose to depend on can have a significant impact on the size, startup time, security, and maintainability of your application for years to come.

In this talk we'll discuss the importance of managing your dependency tree.  We'll talk about the tools you can use to analyze the size, performance, and potential security impact of dependencies *before* adding them to your application.  And of course, we'll talk about the tools you can use to keep it all running smoothly.
