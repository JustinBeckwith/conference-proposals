# Semver is a lie - the law of implicit interfaces

## Abstract

Semver provides us with a language we can use to communicate the types of changes made in our software.  While it's great for expressing the intent of the authors - it absolutely cannot be trusted!  In this talk, we'll explore the concepts of semver, the ills of treating it as a panacea, and a few examples of ways you can protect yourself from unintended breaking changes.
